# Histopathologic-Cancer-Detection Using CNN 

This demo aboards the [Kaggle Learning Contest](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/overview) looking to classify Cancer images in cells. 

## Architecture

I used an ASUS TUF with a 3050 NVIDIA GeForce RTX with 4GB of Graphic Memory and 32 GB of RAM to run this demo.

## Results

As the submission is enabled but the leadearboard is unaccessible, the results was 0.7878 for the private leaderboard and 0.8395 for the public one. Which the equivalent in the leaderboard will be around the place 1000.

## Hints

It is possible to increase the fully connected layers and the early stopping patience to achieve better results.
